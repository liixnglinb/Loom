# Competition Paper Writing (English)

Write a competition paper: **$ARGUMENTS**

## ⚡ Fast-mode detection (run first)

```bash
FAST_MODE=0
grep -q 'MH_FAST_MODE=1' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && FAST_MODE=1
echo "FAST_MODE=$FAST_MODE"
```

**If `FAST_MODE=1` (speed priority):** still MUST produce a complete paper (all chapters present, every sub-problem covered, figures embedded per manifest, body pages meet MAX_PAGES, cite real data — no fabrication, pass output verification), but **SKIP**: line-by-line figure-text number consistency re-checks, source-traceback audits, and repeated polish/rewrite for minor issues. Write it once, complete in structure and content. **If `FAST_MODE=0` (default):** run all consistency checks as usual.

## Constants

- **COMPETITION** — Default `mcm`. From Additional Parameters.
- **MAX_PAGES** — Default 25. Body pages must be ≥ MAX_PAGES.
- **CUSTOM_REQUIREMENTS**

## Inputs

1. PROBLEM_ANALYSIS.md, MODELING_REPORT.md, RESULTS.md
2. figures/, code/

## Load shared rules

```bash
cat _utils/writing_rules.md 2>/dev/null || cat skills/shared-scripts/writing_rules.md
```

## MCM/ICM Paper Structure

## ⛔⛔⛔ Output Contract (highest priority)

**Mandatory output depends on `params.output_format`**:

- **PDF mode**: `paper/main.tex` (≥ 5KB) + `paper/sections/*.tex` + `paper/references.bib`
- **docx mode**: `paper/main.md` (single file, ≥ 5KB). Do NOT create `paper/main.tex`

⛔ **MUST run output verification before ending the step**:
```bash
MODE=$(grep -q "Word（.docx）\|docx mode" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo docx || echo pdf)
PASS=true
if [ "$MODE" = "docx" ]; then
    [ -f paper/main.md ] && SZ=$(wc -c < paper/main.md) || SZ=0
    [ "$SZ" -ge 5120 ] && echo "✅ paper/main.md ($SZ)" || { echo "❌ paper/main.md missing"; PASS=false; }
else
    [ -f paper/main.tex ] && SZ=$(wc -c < paper/main.tex) || SZ=0
    [ "$SZ" -ge 5120 ] && echo "✅ paper/main.tex ($SZ)" || { echo "❌ paper/main.tex missing"; PASS=false; }
    SECT_COUNT=$(ls paper/sections/*.tex 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    [ "$SECT_COUNT" -ge 3 ] && echo "✅ sections ($SECT_COUNT)" || { echo "❌ too few sections"; PASS=false; }
fi
[ "$PASS" != true ] && echo "⛔ Output verification FAILED — must complete before ending"
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Backup + resume check

Back up existing `paper/`. Check for incomplete sections:
```bash
echo "=== Resume check ==="
if [ -d "paper/sections" ]; then
    for f in paper/sections/*.tex; do
        [ -f "$f" ] || continue
        chars=$(wc -c < "$f")
        [ "$chars" -lt 500 ] && echo "⚠ Placeholder: $(basename $f) ($chars chars)" || echo "✅ Complete: $(basename $f) ($chars chars)"
    done
fi
```
Resume: only write placeholder sections, skip completed ones (>2000 chars). Save each section immediately. If approaching output limit, create `% [PLACEHOLDER]` files.

### Step 1: Select template

```bash
mkdir -p paper/sections
TMPL_BASE="_templates"
[ -d "$TMPL_BASE" ] || TMPL_BASE="templates"

if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -qi "mcm\|MCM\|ICM" || grep -qi "mcm\|MCM" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Using MCM template"
    cp "$TMPL_BASE/mcm/"* paper/ 2>/dev/null
elif echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -qi "apmcm\|APMCM\|亚太" || grep -qi "apmcm" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Using APMCM template"
    cp "$TMPL_BASE/apmcm/"* paper/ 2>/dev/null
else
    echo "Using default English template"
    cp "$TMPL_BASE/default/"* paper/ 2>/dev/null
fi
[ -f paper/main.tex ] && echo "Template copied: $(wc -l < paper/main.tex) lines" || echo "ERROR: template not found!"
```

MCM/ICM uses `mcmthesis.cls` (included in template folder). APMCM uses article class.

**⛔ Do not write main.tex from scratch** — copy the template and only replace placeholders. The template handles fonts, margins, headers, and formatting.

### Step 2: Figure inventory

Before writing any section, build a complete inventory of available figures:

```bash
echo "=== Available PDF figures ==="
ls -la figures/*.pdf 2>/dev/null || echo "No PDF figures found"
echo ""
echo "=== Available table files (PDF mode: .tex / Word mode: .md) ==="
ls -la figures/TABLE_*.tex figures/TABLE_*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No TABLE files found"
echo ""
echo "=== latex_includes.tex content (figure→PDF mapping) ==="
cat figures/latex_includes.tex 2>/dev/null || echo "No latex_includes.tex"
echo ""
echo "=== TikZ geometry/algorithm/architecture diagrams ==="
# TikZ generated by paper-figure-html as figures/tikz_diagrams.tex → compiled to figures/tikz_diagrams.pdf
# (legacy name tikz_architecture_examples.tex also accepted). Their \includegraphics blocks are in latex_includes.tex.
ls figures/tikz_*.pdf 2>/dev/null && echo "→ TikZ present, must embed" || echo "No TikZ diagrams"
```

**⛔ MANDATORY: Build a FIGURE EMBEDDING PLAN before writing any section:**
```
FIGURE EMBEDDING PLAN:
1. fig_p1_result.pdf → Problem 1 section → caption: "Figure X: ..."
2. fig_p2_result.pdf → Problem 2 section → caption: "Figure X: ..."
3. TABLE_comparison.tex → Results section → caption: "Table X: ..."
4. tikz_diagrams.pdf (geometry/algorithm/architecture TikZ, from latex_includes.tex) → Introduction/Model section
```

**Rules:**
- **⛔ Must use figure blocks from `latex_includes.tex`**, not write `\includegraphics` from scratch
- **⛔⛔ NEVER change the `width`/`height` in `\includegraphics`**: they are computed by `fig_include_size.py` from each figure's **real aspect ratio** (wide figures widened, tall ones narrowed). Copy verbatim. If you rewrite a tall flow-chart to `width=0.85\textwidth,height=0.9\textheight`, it will be stretched to **fill the whole page** (the root cause of past "flowchart too big" issues). Change only the caption; leave the size untouched.
- **⛔ TikZ diagrams must be embedded**: every `\begin{figure}` block in `latex_includes.tex` that references `tikz_diagrams.pdf` / `tikz_*.pdf` must be copied into a section — do not miss any
- **⛔ Image paths must be `../figures/xxx.pdf`**
- Only embed figures whose PDF files actually exist

**⛔⛔⛔ HTML 引擎 figure embedding (most commonly missed — check each one):**

HTML 引擎 figures (roadmap, flow charts, pipeline diagrams) are appended at the **end** of `latex_includes.tex` by the paper-figure-html step. You MUST embed them:

| HTML 引擎 figure type | Embed location | Section file |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Technical roadmap (fig_roadmap) | End of Introduction/Problem Restatement | `1_introduction.tex` |
| Sub-problem flow chart (fig_flow_q1/q2/q3)<br>⛔ **OFF by default** — if it is not in `latex_includes.tex`, skip it; never reference it out of thin air | Inside each sub-problem's "Model Construction" subsection, preceded by 2-3 sentences introducing the solving approach and main steps | `4_problem1.tex`, `5_problem2.tex` etc. |
| Data pipeline (fig_pipeline) | Data preprocessing section | Data/method section |
| TikZ geometry/algorithm (tikz_diagrams.pdf) | Geometry → relevant sub-problem section; algorithm flow → Model Construction subsection | Sub-problem/Model section |

**⛔⛔ HARD RULE: sub-problem flow charts MUST be spread across their own problem sections — NEVER pile all of them into the "Problem Analysis" (2_analysis) chapter.**
Cramming fig_flow_q1~q5 into the analysis chapter is the most common and ugliest failure: a single section with 5 large figures makes LaTeX's float mechanism push them all to the top of the section in a stack, shoving body text to the back and severely unbalancing the layout. Correct: `fig_flow_q1` → `4_problem1.tex`, `fig_flow_q2` → `5_problem2.tex`, … one per section, right after that problem's introductory sentences. The analysis chapter (2_analysis) keeps **at most the overall roadmap fig_roadmap**; no other flow chart may appear there.

**After writing all sections, verify HTML 引擎/TikZ figures are embedded:**
```bash
echo "=== HTML 引擎/TikZ embedding check ==="
for pdf in figures/fig_roadmap.pdf figures/fig_flow_*.pdf figures/fig_pipeline*.pdf figures/fig_framework*.pdf; do
    [ -f "$pdf" ] || continue
    bn=$(basename "$pdf")
    grep -rq "$bn" paper/sections/*.tex paper/main.tex 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ $bn embedded" || echo "❌ $bn NOT embedded — fix now!"
done
# ⛔ TikZ check by PDF filename (most reliable)
for tpdf in figures/tikz_diagrams.pdf figures/tikz_diagrams_*.pdf figures/tikz_*.pdf; do
    [ -f "$tpdf" ] || continue
    tbn=$(basename "$tpdf")
    grep -rq "$tbn" paper/sections/*.tex paper/main.tex 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ TikZ $tbn embedded" || echo "❌ TikZ $tbn NOT embedded — fix now!"
done
# ⛔ Flow-chart stacking check: the analysis chapter (2_analysis) must hold ≤1 sub-problem
#    flow chart, otherwise fig_flow_q1~q5 were wrongly piled into the analysis chapter.
_analysis_tex=$(ls paper/sections/2_*.tex 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$_analysis_tex" ]; then
    _flow_in_analysis=$(grep -oE 'fig_flow_q[0-9]+' "$_analysis_tex" 2>/dev/null | sort -u | wc -l)
    if [ "$_flow_in_analysis" -ge 2 ]; then
        echo "❌ Analysis chapter contains $_flow_in_analysis sub-problem flow charts — violates HARD RULE! Move fig_flow_q1~q5 to their own problem sections (4_problem1.tex etc.); the analysis chapter keeps at most fig_roadmap."
    else
        echo "✅ Flow charts not piled into the analysis chapter"
    fi
fi
```

Also scan `figures/*.tex` for all `\begin{figure}` / `\begin{table}` blocks with their `\label{}`. After writing, verify all embedded:
```bash
grep -oh '\\label{[^}]*}' figures/*.tex 2>/dev/null | sort -u > _tmp/all_fig_labels.txt
grep -oh '\\label{[^}]*}' paper/sections/*.tex paper/main.tex 2>/dev/null | sort -u > _tmp/embedded_labels.txt
comm -23 _tmp/all_fig_labels.txt _tmp/embedded_labels.txt  # should be empty
```

Follow interleaving and embedding rules from `_utils/writing_rules.md`.

**⛔ Figure-text interleaving hard rules (every section must follow):**
- **Float specifiers (pin figures in place)**: figures use `\begin{figure}[H]`; tables use `\begin{table}[H]` (both in place). `[H]` pins each figure directly under the paragraph that introduces it, so figures never float away and — crucially — **multiple figures can never stack together on one page** (the stacking problem `[htbp]` used to cause). The template still loads `\usepackage[section]{placeins}` (`\FloatBarrier` at each section end) as a safety net for any residual floating body. Trade-off: on the rare occasion a figure is nearly full-page-tall and lands near the page bottom, `[H]` leaves whitespace above it — but figures are already height-capped at `0.9\textheight` and the writing rules force text before and after every figure, so this is rare and far less harmful than illegible stacked figures. ⛔ Do NOT give tables `[htbp]`: floating pushes them to the section end, leaving half a blank page above the table (symbol/notation tables are the usual victims); short tables use `[H]`, long tables use `\begin{longtable}`. Pseudocode keeps `\begin{algorithm}[H]`.
- **⛔⛔ Figures must be drawn out by the argument, not stamped with a template sentence (hard rule)**: embed every figure in the prose so the argument itself leads into it — the reader reaches this point and naturally needs to see this figure. The one test that matters: **it reads as a smooth narrative, not as one label slapped on each figure in turn.**
  - **✅ Three goals to reach (goals, NOT a sentence template, and NOT a fixed structure to copy for every figure)**: make the reader understand (1) what this figure shows, (2) what earlier point it follows from, (3) what conclusion it supports. How you weave these into the paragraph — in what order, in what sentence structure — is up to you as the prose dictates: state the conclusion then show the figure as evidence, or describe the phenomenon then bring in the figure to explain it. **What varies is HOW you write (structure, entry angle, order); what does NOT vary is HOW DEEP you go.**
  - **⛔⛔ Depth floor for post-figure analysis (hard rule, the second core problem being fixed here)**: the discussion around each figure must **never be dispatched in a single sentence** (e.g. "See Fig. 24: the inbound spiral, two arcs, and outbound spiral join smoothly at the tangent points" — a lone sentence like this is a failure). Each figure's prose (lead-in + follow-up combined) **must land all three of the following, none omissible**: (1) **concrete numbers** — the key figures read off the plot (max radius 4.229 m, 7.59% shorter, peak 1.72 m/s), not a vague "clear trend"; (2) **comparison or trend** — against a baseline / other scheme / the previous sub-problem, or how a quantity varies along some axis; (3) **inference or linkage** — what this figure proves, what bottleneck it exposes, which next step it leads into. If you cannot do all three, the figure adds nothing to the argument and should not be included.
    - **❌ Perfunctory anti-example (the current failure mode, forbidden)**: "The arc-length optimization and comparison are shown in Fig. 25: multiple starts converge to the same optimal neighborhood, and the optimum stays below the baseline." — one sentence, no numbers, no quantified comparison, cut off abruptly.
    - **✅ Benchmark example (the fullness to emulate)**: "Fig. 15 shows the collision radius decreasing strictly monotonically as the pitch grows: as the pitch rises from 0.4 m to 0.55 m, the collision radius falls from 7.04 m to 2.289 m; the intersection of the data points with the R_t = 4.5 m threshold line lands exactly at the critical pitch p_min = 0.448 m, with the left side unable to spiral in and the right side able to. The moderate slope near the intersection indicates that the critical-pitch inversion is stable and the bisection is well-conditioned." — numbers, monotonic trend, threshold crossing, and a stability inference all present, in natural non-formulaic prose.
  - **⛔⛔ No formulaic sentence patterns (the core problem being fixed here)**: never write every figure with the same skeleton, especially the "[figure type] (Fig. N) + verb + one-line conclusion" opener (e.g. "The waterfall chart (Fig. 33) decomposes…", "The radar chart (Fig. 34) compares…", "The heatmap (Fig. 35) shows…" — several figures in a row opening this way is a failure). **For adjacent figures and figures in the same section, vary the entry angle and sentence structure**: lead from the prior conclusion, from the question being answered, from an anomaly visible in the figure, or fold the figure into an argument already in flow without a dedicated opening sentence. Write like a good paper, not like issuing an identically-formatted caption card for each figure.
  - **✅ Figure numbers MUST be cited explicitly (academic norm, fully compatible with "no formulaic patterns")**: every figure must be named in the prose ("Fig. N") so the reader can map the paragraph to the exact figure — this is a hard requirement; do not drop figure numbers just to avoid templating. **What varies is the citation's sentence structure and position, not whether you cite.** Rotate among these entry styles, and don't use the same one for two adjacent figures: sentence-start ("In the pipeline of Fig. 3, the third stage…"), mid-sentence parenthetical ("…this premise holds (see Fig. 2): propagation and text intensity…"), verb-led ("Observing the three curves in Fig. 4, the difference concentrates in…"), figure-as-subject ("Fig. 5 compares the proposed method against the baseline…", **used at most once per section, never as the default opener; two adjacent figures both opening with "Fig. N…" is an outright violation**), or post-hoc confirmation ("…this conclusion is confirmed in Fig. 6."). The number must always appear — just don't open every figure with the one "Fig. N + verb + one-line conclusion" pattern.
  - **⛔ No boilerplate placeholders**: sentences like "as shown in Fig. X", "the figure below shows the results", "Fig. X is the flowchart" carry no real information and would hold true for any figure — they count as nothing. If you cannot say what is unique about this figure and why it matters to the argument, the figure adds nothing and should not be included ("if it's not useful, better not to include it").
  - **⛔ Define jargon and internal codes in plain words at first use**: any specialized term, pipeline code, or variable shorthand (e.g. C4, blend, ridge distribution, weakly-supervised self-consistency upper bound) must first be explained in one plain sentence — what it is / what it measures — before being used. Never drop raw internal pipeline codes or working names into the prose; the paper is written for reviewers, not for the pipeline.
  - **⛔ Keep captions SHORT — a label (body ≤14 words, excluding the "Figure N" number)**: `\caption{}` holds only a short noun phrase naming what the figure is; criteria, parameters, axis meanings, and conclusions go into the prose, not the caption (long ones wrap to ugly multi-line blocks). Anti-example `\caption{Coverage-radius geometry: station as center, R=3km coverage circle, dispatch distance and response-time criterion}` → short form `\caption{Station coverage-radius geometry}`. See the caption-length rule in `_utils/writing_rules.md`; the compile step scans caption length and flags overruns.
- Every figure/table must also be followed by ≥5 lines of analysis text (data interpretation + comparison + conclusion) before the next figure
- Absolutely no consecutive `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}` environments with no prose paragraph between them; if two figures must appear back-to-back, write a transition paragraph explaining their logical relationship
- **⛔ Logic diagrams (flowchart / architecture / roadmap / pipeline / framework / TikZ geometry·algorithm·architecture sketches) must occupy their own `figure` — never place two side-by-side.** They rely on legible node text and connectors; shrinking to half text-width makes them illegible, and they are not same-axes trend comparisons so side-by-side yields no information gain. Even two related flowcharts go in separate figures with a transition paragraph between. (Data-result figures may still be combined via a single matplotlib-composed PDF, per the width rule below.)
- **🟡 Not every data figure should be paired — single-column by default, whitespace is the trigger**: data-result figures default to one-per-row; only pair two into a 2-panel when they are **same-kind/comparable** (e.g. two variables' distributions, same-kind curves for two scenarios) **and** each alone would fill only half a page, leaving over half a page of whitespace after its text. Unrelated figures stay single-column even if sparse — never pair just to fill the page (see `_utils/writing_rules.md` rule 4, decision step 3.5).
- Use `\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth,keepaspectratio]` (width-driven, let height auto-scale). ⛔ Do NOT add a small `height=0.38\textheight` cap — with `keepaspectratio`, a height cap can only **shrink** the figure: near-square or tall figures (heatmaps, radar charts, forest plots, confusion matrices, stacked subplots, flowcharts) get clamped to ~half text-width and look tiny. Only add `height=0.9\textheight` as an overflow guard when a single figure is genuinely near a full page tall

### Step 2.5: Pre-fetch verified reference pool

**⛔ MUST complete before writing any \citep{} in Step 3.**

```bash
PYTHON=""; for _c in "$MH_PYTHON" python python3; do [ -z "$_c" ] && continue; if $_c -c "import sys" >/dev/null 2>&1; then PYTHON="$_c"; break; fi; done; [ -z "$PYTHON" ] && PYTHON=python
mkdir -p _tmp
# Search for real papers in your topic areas (adapt queries to your paper)
# Example:
#   $PYTHON "$SCHOLAR_SCRIPT" bibtex "your core method keywords" --max 5
#   $PYTHON "$SCHOLAR_SCRIPT" bibtex "your research domain keywords" --max 5
```

Create `_tmp/_verified_refs.txt` with verified papers. Only cite papers from this pool when writing. Search and verify before adding new citations.

**Fallback**: If `scholar_fetch.py` returns no results or `match_label="low"` for a topic, use WebSearch to find the paper on Google Scholar / Semantic Scholar website, then manually verify title + authors + year before adding to the pool.

### Step 3: Write each section

**⛔ CRITICAL: Do NOT write the Summary Sheet now.** Skip Section 0 entirely. Write a placeholder `[Summary Sheet — fill in Step 4.6 after all chapters are complete]` in the Summary Sheet position. The Summary Sheet MUST be written LAST (after Step 4.5) because it needs specific numerical results from all chapters. Writing it first = making up numbers.

Come back to fill the Summary Sheet in Step 4.6, after all body chapters are complete. At that point, read `RESULTS.md` and all section .tex files to extract the actual numbers.

**⛔ MCM/ICM chapter order (must follow template):**
```
1_introduction.tex  — Problem background + restatement + approach overview
2_assumptions.tex   — Assumptions and justifications
3_symbols.tex       — Notation table (use non-floating table: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}, NOT \begin{table})
4_model.tex         — Model development (or split per sub-problem)
5_results.tex       — Results and analysis
6_sensitivity.tex   — Sensitivity analysis
7_strengths.tex     — Strengths and weaknesses
A_code.tex          — Appendix: code
```
File names must match template `\input{sections/...}` lines.

**⛔ Before writing each section, read MODELING_REPORT.md and RESULTS.md** for exact numbers and formulas.

**⛔ Cross-chapter context + figure-data binding (prevents the "two-layers" disconnect):**
- **After finishing each section**, append a 3-5 line card to `_writing_context.md` in the workspace root (core claim / key numbers / newly defined symbols & terms / figures discussed); **`cat _writing_context.md` before writing the next section** to carry forward prior conclusions, reuse defined terms (don't redefine), and keep every metric's number consistent — see `<chapter_context_card>` in `_utils/writing_rules.md`.
- **Before writing the analysis for any figure/table**, follow `<figure_data_binding>`: identify *what quantity the figure plots* from FIGURE_MANIFEST/latex_includes → locate its real values in `RESULTS.md`/`figures/all_results.json` → use only those real numbers. **Never guess numbers from the plot's shape/position, never fabricate coordinates.**

**⛔ No `\begin{itemize}` or `\begin{enumerate}` in body text** — use flowing prose. Inline numbering "(1)...(2)..." is acceptable.

<exemplar_depth>
#### Writing depth reference

**MCM/ICM Outstanding Paper (25 pages total, including everything)**:
- Summary Sheet (1p): 300-400 words, self-contained with specific numerical results. Structure: problem statement (1-2 sentences) → method (2-3 sentences) → key results (3-4 sentences with numbers) → conclusion (1-2 sentences)
- Introduction (2p): problem context + literature + approach overview
- Assumptions (0.5p): each assumption with justification (not just a bullet list)
- Notations (0.5p): **use non-floating table** (`\begin{center}\begin{tabular}` + `\captionof{table}{}`, NOT `\begin{table}`). This prevents the section title and table from being split across pages. Keep to 15-20 symbols max.
- Each sub-problem (4-5p): model formulation (1.5p, with derivation) + solution method (1p, with algorithm) + results with table+figure+numbers (1p) + analysis (0.5-1p, interpretation + comparison)
- Sensitivity Analysis (2-3p): ≥2 key parameters, each with variation plot + analysis paragraph
- Model Evaluation (1.5p): 3-5 strengths + 2-3 weaknesses (honest, not token weaknesses) + generalization discussion
- References + Appendix (3-4p)

**APMCM First Prize (25-30 pages)**: similar but can be longer, 5-6 pages per sub-problem with more detailed analysis.
</exemplar_depth>

After each chapter, check chars:
```bash
chars=$(wc -c < "paper/sections/current_chapter.tex")
echo "Current chapter: $chars chars"
# English LaTeX ≈ 2000-2500 chars/page
# If sub-problem chapter expected 4 pages but only 4000 chars (~2 pages), expand immediately
```

**Expansion strategies** (not padding — substantive content):
- Formula without derivation → add step-by-step derivation with physical meaning
- Result with only "as shown in Table X" → add 2-3 paragraphs (what numbers mean, comparison with expectations, why this result makes sense)
- Algorithm as pseudocode only → add explanation of key steps, complexity analysis, convergence discussion

**Summary Sheet** is the most important page — invest the most effort here. Must be self-contained, one page, ≥300 words, with quantitative results.

**Each sub-problem chapter**: model formulation → solution method → results (table + figure + numbers) → result analysis (2-3 paragraphs of interpretation)

**Sensitivity Analysis**: parameter sensitivity + robustness + error analysis

**Model Evaluation**: Strengths 3-5 points + Weaknesses 2-3 points (honest) — do not write token weaknesses like "limited by time"

### Step 4: Build bibliography

Follow the `<references_workflow>` in `_utils/writing_rules.md`.
Search DBLP/CrossRef for real BibTeX. `\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}`.

**⛔ Use scholar_fetch.py for ALL reference retrieval. NEVER fabricate BibTeX from memory.**

**⛔ Citation key rule: when writing body text, citation keys MUST contain descriptive keywords, format: `author_year_topic_keywords`.**
Example: `\citep{wang_2023_supply_chain_resilience}` not `\citep{wang2023supply}`.
If unsure about author/year, use `TODO__` prefix: `\citep{TODO__digital_economy_spatial_spillover}`.

```bash
# Step 4a: Collect all cited keys
grep -roh '\\cite[tp]*{[^}]*}' paper/sections/*.tex paper/main.tex 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -oP '\{[^}]+\}' | tr -d '{}' | tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' | sort -u > _tmp/_cited_keys.txt
echo "Cited keys: $(wc -l < _tmp/_cited_keys.txt)"

# Step 4b: Fetch BibTeX using descriptive keywords from citation keys
PYTHON=""; for _c in "$MH_PYTHON" python python3; do [ -z "$_c" ] && continue; if $_c -c "import sys" >/dev/null 2>&1; then PYTHON="$_c"; break; fi; done; [ -z "$PYTHON" ] && PYTHON=python
while IFS= read -r key; do
    query=$(echo "$key" | sed 's/^TODO__//; s/_/ /g')
    echo "--- Fetching: $key (query: $query) ---"
    $PYTHON "$SCHOLAR_SCRIPT" bibtex "$query" --max 3
    sleep 0.5
done < _tmp/_cited_keys.txt
```

For each result:
1. Check `match_label`: `"good"` → use directly. `"partial"` → verify title. `"low"` → likely wrong paper, re-search or use WebSearch.
2. `match_score` < 0.3 means the result probably doesn't match your citation intent. Do NOT blindly use it.
3. Replace citation keys in .tex files with actual keys from BibTeX entries.
4. Mark `bibtex_source=auto` with `% [VERIFY]`. Mark `match_label="low"` with `% [LOW_MATCH]`.

### Step 4.5: De-AI polish

See `<de_ai_polish>` in `_utils/writing_rules.md`.

### Step 4.6: Write Summary Sheet LAST

⛔ **MANDATORY: NOW write the Summary Sheet** (replace the placeholder from Step 3).

Read `RESULTS.md` and all section .tex files first to extract actual numerical results. Then write the Summary Sheet using only those verified numbers — do not invent any value.

Structure: problem statement (1-2 sentences) → method (2-3 sentences) → key results with specific numbers (3-4 sentences) → conclusion (1-2 sentences). 300-400 words, one page. Self-contained — readers should grasp the entire paper from this page alone.

⛔⛔ **Bold the key content in the Summary Sheet (Summary Sheet only, LaTeX `\textbf{}`)**: judges skim the summary; bolding the core method and result is a plus. **Bold ONLY these three "conclusion anchors":**
1. **Key result numbers** (final answers): e.g. `\textbf{2376.8}`, `\textbf{98.7\%}`, `\textbf{12.4 km}` (note `%` must be `\%` in LaTeX)
2. **Core method/model names**: e.g. `\textbf{NSGA-II}`, `\textbf{XGBoost}` — bold each name only at its first/conclusion appearance, not every mention
3. **The single most critical noun** in a conclusion sentence

⛔ **Bold discipline (avoid over-bolding — less is more):** 1~3 bolds per paragraph, ≤ 12 total; never bold whole sentences / background / connectives / a repeated method name; use `\textbf{}` only (NOT markdown `**`); do not touch the `\textbf{Keywords:}` label; `\textbf{}` only wraps text — numbers must still be pulled truthfully from the body, never invented for emphasis. Example: `We build an \textbf{NSGA-II} model, achieving optimal cost \textbf{2376.8}, a \textbf{12.3\%} reduction.`

⛔⛔ **Break the Summary Sheet into per-problem paragraphs — never cram every problem into one block.** Paragraph skeleton:
- Paragraph 1: background + overall modeling approach
- Then one paragraph per problem, **each starting with "For Problem 1 / For Problem 2 / ..." and standing alone** (method + specific numbers)
- Final paragraph: model evaluation / strengths / outlook
- **Separate paragraphs with a blank line.** A judge must be able to locate each problem's answer at a glance.

⛔ **Hard rule: a single paragraph must NOT contain two or more "For Problem" openers.** Examples:

```text
(correct ✅ — each "For Problem X" is its own paragraph, blank line between)
This paper addresses ... by building ... models.

For Problem 1, we first ... and adopt ...; the optimal solution is ..., with fitness 0.917.

For Problem 2, we construct ...; MAPE drops from 29.48% to 14.93%.

For Problem 3, ...; predicted values are 952.8, 1570.5, 11030.9.

Sensitivity analysis shows ...; the model evaluation indicates ....
```

```text
(wrong ❌ — Problems 2 and 3 crammed into one paragraph)
For Problem 2, MAPE 14.93%. For Problem 3, predicted values are 952.8, 1570.5.
```

After writing, grep the body chapters for every number you used to verify it actually appears:

```bash
for n in $(grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' paper/sections/0_summary.tex | sort -u); do
  grep -q "$n" paper/sections/*.tex RESULTS.md || echo "⛔ Summary number $n not in body: invented?"
done
```

⛔ **Then run the paragraph self-check (detect → fix → recheck loop; use `python`, not `python3`):**
```bash
python - paper/sections/0_summary.tex <<'PY'
import re, sys
path = sys.argv[1]
try:
    text = open(path, encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore").read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"⚠ {path} not found — locate the Summary Sheet file and rerun with its actual path"); sys.exit(0)
bad = []
for i, para in enumerate(re.split(r"\n\s*\n", text), 1):
    if len(re.findall(r"[Ff]or [Pp]roblem", para)) > 1:
        bad.append((i, para.strip()[:80]))
if bad:
    print(f"❌ {len(bad)} paragraph(s) cram multiple 'For Problem' openers — split each into its own paragraph:")
    for i, snip in bad:
        print(f"  para {i}: {snip}...")
    sys.exit(1)
print("✓ Summary Sheet is split per problem")
PY
```
⛔ **Loop rule: if the check exits 1, go back to `paper/sections/0_summary.tex`, insert a blank line before each "For Problem X" so it becomes its own paragraph, then rerun the check until it prints "✓ Summary Sheet is split per problem" before moving on.**

### Step 4.7: AI tool usage statement (only when the user enabled it)

```bash
AI_DISC=off
grep -q 'MH_AI_DISCLOSURE=used' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && AI_DISC=used
grep -q 'MH_AI_DISCLOSURE=none' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && AI_DISC=none
echo "AI_DISC=$AI_DISC"
```

- `AI_DISC=off` (default) → **skip this step entirely**; produce no disclosure content (byte-identical to current output).
- `AI_DISC=used` / `none` → read and **strictly follow** `_utils/ai_disclosure_rules.md` (this is a **LaTeX** project → use its "LaTeX" branch: write `sections/Z_ai_disclosure.tex`, list AI tools in the bibliography, for `used` also write `appendix/B_ai_detail.tex` with the four tables (in `appendix/`, so it does not count toward body pages), then run `_utils/inject_ai_disclosure.py` to insert the `\input` lines):
  ```bash
  cat _utils/ai_disclosure_rules.md 2>/dev/null || cat skills/shared-scripts/ai_disclosure_rules.md
  ```
  ⛔ Write everything in **English** (section title "AI Tool Usage Statement"; "The team did not use any AI tools during the competition." for the `none` case). Randomize per paper (models / wording / purposes / interaction logs all differ), pick dates within the contest range, strictly avoid the Article 9 forbidden uses (only legitimate auxiliary uses: language polishing / code debugging / formatting / reference formatting / terminology). Keep interaction logs to ~2 entries.

### Step 5: Final verification

```bash
bash _utils/writing_check.sh paper/ 2>/dev/null || bash skills/shared-scripts/writing_check.sh paper/
```

**⛔ Capability-claim gate (full-chain contract, run before AND after writing; zero-cost, both modes):** The paper must not claim capabilities that failed acceptance in the coding stage.
```bash
FAST_MODE=0; grep -q 'MH_FAST_MODE=1' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && FAST_MODE=1
python _utils/paper_claim_check.py --audit CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md --checklist CAPABILITY_CHECKLIST.json --sections paper/sections --fast $FAST_MODE
PCC=$?   # 0=all passed 1=some capability FAIL/PENDING (must not finalize) 2=no audit, skip
```
> `PCC=1`: a capability failed acceptance in comp-code — go back and make it truly PASS before finalizing. WARN (a not-passed capability's name appears in the body): confirm you are not writing an undone capability as done (OK only if honestly stated under Limitations/Future work). Contract chain: problem-analysis defines it → modeling claims each → code implements & audits → paper reports only what passed.

Also check:
```bash
echo "=== Section character counts ==="
total=0
for f in paper/sections/*.tex; do
    chars=$(wc -c < "$f")
    total=$((total + chars))
    echo "  $(basename $f): $chars chars (~$(echo "scale=1; $chars/2200" | bc) pages)"
done
echo "  Total: $total chars (~$(echo "scale=1; $total/2200" | bc) pages)"
```
- Total chars ≥ MAX_PAGES × 1800 (expand thinnest chapters if not)
- Any sub-problem chapter <8000 chars (~4 pages) needs expansion
- Summary Sheet exists (MCM/ICM critical)
- All figures/*.pdf and TABLE files (PDF mode .tex / Word mode .md) referenced in sections/body
- No `\input{figures}` patterns **except `\input{../figures/TABLE_*.tex}`** — tables are embedded
  that way by design; figures must have their `\begin{figure}` block copied into sections (so the
  caption gets shortened/translated on the way). `writing_check.sh` follows `\input` recursively,
  so a table caption over the limit (ZH ≤20 chars / EN ≤14 words) is still caught — fix it in the
  `figures/TABLE_*.tex` source, not in `sections/`.
- Team Control Number placeholder present

**⛔ Page count pre-check (MUST pass before finishing):**

> ⛔ **MAX_PAGES counts BODY pages only** (chapters 1 → conclusion, including figures/tables).
> Does **NOT** include abstract / TOC / references / **appendix code**.
> Check scans `paper/sections/*.tex` only; appendix code goes in `paper/appendix/` (separate, no page cap).

fi
```
If estimated pages < 80% of MAX_PAGES, expand the thinnest chapters before finishing.

⛔ **Body vs Appendix file convention**:
- `paper/sections/` — body chapters only (intro / methods / results / discussion / conclusion)
- `paper/appendix/` — code listings / long data tables / solver logs / supplementary derivations / pseudocode
- Putting code in `sections/` inflates est_pages but body is actually thin

### Step 6: Compliance check

Page count, Summary Sheet, Team Control Number, anonymous, APMCM commitment letter not in PDF, code appendix.

## Key Rules

- Summary Sheet is everything — invest the most effort here
- Specific numbers — never say "good results", give exact values
- Figure paths: `../figures/xxx.pdf`
- ⛔⛔ **Tables**: `[H]` float specifier **ONLY** (not `[!ht]` / `[ht]` / `[htbp]` / `[tb]` / `[b]` / `[p]`). (Figures use `[H]` too — pinned in place right under their lead-in text to prevent multi-figure stacking; see the interleaving rules above.)
  All competition templates load `\usepackage[section]{placeins}` which forces `\FloatBarrier` at end of each `\section`, blocking float migration across sections. With `[!ht]` and a tall table + lead-in text, LaTeX is forced to leave the section heading + lead-in text at top of page and dump the table at section bottom → **half a blank page above the table**. Symbol tables / notation tables are the most common victims. Solution: use `\begin{longtable}` (non-floating) for symbol tables; use `\begin{table}[H]` (forces in-place) for short result tables.
- After writing, run this grep audit:
  ```bash
  BAD=$(grep -rEn '\\begin\{table\}\[(!?ht?|htbp|tb|b|p)\]' paper/sections/ 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$BAD" ]; then
      echo "❌ Found floating table specifiers (may cause blank-page-above-table):"
      echo "$BAD" | head -5
      echo "   Fix: change to \\begin{table}[H] or \\begin{longtable}"
  fi
  ```
- Wide tables (≥6 cols): wrap with `\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{...}`
- Narrow tables (≤4 cols): do not use `\resizebox`
- Code appendix: complete runnable code
- No team info — use placeholders
- `\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}`
- Primary output: `paper/` directory, temp files: `_tmp/`
- ⛔ **This step only writes paper .tex files. Do NOT regenerate figure PDFs, modify code/*.py, or re-run analysis scripts.** Figures and data are already produced by prior steps (paper-figure / comp-code) — just reference them
- Large files: Bash heredoc

## ⛔ Universal paper-stage audit (shared across all writing steps)

Before finishing writing / compiling, run the universal audit. Works without `PROBLEM_FACTS.json`:

```bash
# Universal paper audit:
#   [13] Conclusion consistency: paper text ↔ results.json (prevent "optimal=X but paper says Y")
#   [14] Event source attribution (prevent "guessing source from variable name")
# Falls back to simplified mode if no PROBLEM_FACTS.json (general academic / course / humanities).
if [ -f _utils/facts_audit.py ]; then
    python3 _utils/facts_audit.py --stage paper 2>&1 | tee -a AUDIT_REPORT.md
    PRC=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
    if [ "$PRC" = "1" ]; then
        echo "❌ Universal paper-stage audit failed — fix paper text / results.json before finishing"
    fi
fi

# ⛔ Figure-size consistency gate (stops "body enlarged flowchart/TikZ/data-figure size → fills whole page"):
#   compares each body \includegraphics width/height vs the latex_includes.tex baseline; any mismatch
#   means the size was altered at embed time (often the "min width 0.8" rule mis-hitting tall figures).
#   ⛔ Use ${PIPESTATUS[0]} for the exit code (with | tee, $? captures tee's 0 and swallows the FAIL).
if [ -f _utils/fig_size_consistency_check.py ]; then
    python3 _utils/fig_size_consistency_check.py --latex figures/latex_includes.tex --paperdir paper 2>&1 | tee -a AUDIT_REPORT.md
    SIZE_RC=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
    if [ "$SIZE_RC" = "1" ]; then
        echo "❌ Figure sizes altered: body width/height differs from latex_includes.tex. Restore each figure to the baseline size (copy latex_includes verbatim), then compile."
